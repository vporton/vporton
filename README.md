# The Book Revolution

[Global revolution since 8 Nov 2021](https://science.vporton.name/2021/11/10/a-single-math-studybook-not-published-global-revolution-started-8-nov-2021/) after me having finding _forged global data graphs_ (strategy of dropping the ring of hate into the sea) - winning is sure - pay to [this link](https://my.israelgives.org/en/join/GlobalRevolution)

If _one_ graph is forged, it can bring down all science - because all science is connected.

## Smartest person in history

As far as I know (Correct me if I’m wrong.), nobody else discovered more than one fundamental branch of mathematics (Von Neumann discovered several, but they are not quite fundamental), I did this about 3 times. So in a sense, I am the smartest human in History (except Jesus).

I made the following mathematical discoveries (https://math.portonvictor.org):

- “filtrators” (a generalization of filters on lattices and partially ordered sets)
- algebraic general topology, a generalization of general topology: **“funcoids” and “reloids”** and their properties (later I noticed also (not yet published) that funcoids are a special case of monotone ternary component-wise monotone operations on ordered sets (or on semilattices))
- **ternary operations on ordered sets** or **ternary operations on semilattices** (or particularly **triples on ordered sets** or **triples on semilattices**) as a generalization of general topology.
- definition of properties of “point-free funcoids” – generalizations of funcoids kinda “multidimensional” general topology (where the traditional one is in a sense 2-dimensional)
- definition of such things as the action of a partially ordered semigroup, the action of a partially ordered precategory, **“space” and “interspace”** as an element of such semigroups and precategories (“space in general” in the framework of general topology) and their basic properties
- definition and properties of a generalization of the limit, defined for an arbitrary function at all points
- axiomatic description of **finite and infinite “formulas”**

As far as I know, nobody else in History discovered more than one fundamental branch of mathematics. The very fundamental big branches of mathematics I discovered are emphasized above with bold font. (I didn’t also emphasize “filtrators” because this branch doesn’t seem very big.)

By the way, the three ones I discovered are probably the last ones (so, likely the most difficult to discover).
