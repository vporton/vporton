The AI decides the worth of the user by Web search related to his/her linked accounts. If a user creates several duplicate accounts, they are automatically merged. The app is protected from intruders by several means. The current version is Node.js-based and uses a custodial wallet. I am going to rewrite it as a fully on-chain ICP blockchain app to have a non-custodial wallet. The main intentions of the app is to solve the scientific publication crisis (\"scientific coveries\" - when something having been discoveried by a poor scientist remove the topic from publicity), that hinders development of science and world economy at least by several times.",

Discoveries also contain discontinuous analysis, that already has the power for engineers, physiscists, etc. to much simplify their computations.",
